# Downtime.

## Inspiration:

The Author Jeffrey Anshel from the book Viusal Ergonomics Book does a deep dive into the best practices for the human body when using a computer.
With over 200 pages of analysis, I would recommended that everyone takes some time to at least skim through the ideas Mr. Anshel tries to explain. Cited hundreds of times, this book written in 2005 acts as a golden handbook for proper use of a computer. From posture to a perfect desk lamp, this book covers a lot... So instead of focusing on every aspect of the book, I found one part of the book quite interesting: *Chapter 9 - Kids and Computers.*  However, I think that the chapter title is a quite misleading. While the chapter does mention techinques for children and the way they interact with computers, these rules still very much apply for us adults. The book doesn't elobarate as much as I wished on the fact that adults can fall for the same mistakes children make. For example, Jeffrey Anshel says:
> Children may not be good at regulating their own computer usage
and parents and teachers should be aware of the importance of appropriate
intervals and encourage children to learn when to take breaks from computer
use.

This may be due to the fact that this book was written many years ago in 2005 before addictive apps like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, become very popular. So I decided to take the rules Anshel says about children in Chapter 9, and put these techinques in not only children but adults as well.
### Solution

Mr. Anshel spilts the latter part of the chapter 9 into four sections.

##### Eye Breaks
> Looking at a computer screen for a while can cause
some changes in how the eyes are working, for example, the rate of
blinking will decrease which means that the tear film of the eye is
not being refreshed and dirt and debris is not being cleaned from
the eye surface as frequently as normal.
Look away from the screen for a minute at something in the distance, preferable something more than 20 feet away to allow for the muscles in the eye to relax.

##### Micro-breaks
Most typing and mousing is done intermittently in bursts rather than as continious movements.
So when you are on that intermit break, you should rest your hands in a relaxed, straight posture. Breaks every 15 minutes allows for decrease reports of eyestrain, blurred vision, and complaints of elbow and arm discomfort. Additionally, it allows for the most effecitent performance of computer tasks.

##### Rest breaks
To allow the body to improve blood circulation, and reduce the accumulation of static muscle fatigue, he recommends taking a *brief rest break* where they stand up, move around, and step away from the comupter. 

##### The Exercise breaks
To reduce muscle fatigue, *gentle exercises* can be done every 1-2h. Specific examples of excersises that can be done are listed in Chapter 10 in the *General Body Exercises* section.
A few listed below:
- A Pectoral strech
- A Disk Reliever
- Pelvic Tilt
- Head Roll

# What does the app Downtime Aim to Do?

Every twenty minutes the user is guided to take a break from whatever task they are doing by displaying an overlay across their entire screen. 

Every sixity minutes over a single session, the user is guided to move around and just step away from their keyboard.

Every second hour over a single session the user is guided to perform some streches and physical activity. Streches will be recommeneded to the user from the pop-up screen.

The app contains instructions and animations of stretches to relieve stiffness and pain from sitting behind a compnuter for a prolonged period.


Downtime aims to give your eyes, body, and mind the proper break it needs by following a scientifically researched interval of breaks and actions to perform during those breaks"
