# Inspiration
The Author Jeffrey Anshel, from the book Visual Ergonomics, does a deep dive into the best practices for the human body when using a computer. With over 200 pages of analysis, I recommend that everyone take some time to at least skim through the ideas Mr. Anshel tries to explain. This book, written in 2005, is cited hundreds of times and acts as a golden handbook for adequately using a computer. From posture to a perfect desk lamp, this book covers a lot.

So instead of focusing on every aspect of the book, I honed into one part of the book I was particularly interested in: *Chapter 9 - Kids and Computers.*  However, I think that the chapter title is misleading. While the chapter mentions techniques for children and how they interact with computers, these rules still apply to us adults. Furthermore, since this book was written in 2005, I think he didn't even consider how addicting computers would get, even for the most diligent adults. So, a lot of these <i>rules</i> are initially intended for younger people, but as you will see, children and adults could benefit tremendously from using these techniques.


# Methods
These are some of the methods that Mr. Ashnel discussed in his book. I picked these because I thought I could implement some software to aid with the suggested techniques. (Ashnel 137)

##### Eye Breaks
Looking at a computer screen for a while can cause
some changes in how the eyes are working, for example, the rate of
blinking will decrease which means that the tear film of the eye is
not being refreshed and dirt and debris is not being cleaned from
the eye surface as frequently as normal.
Look away from the screen for a minute at something in the distance, preferable something more than 20 feet away to allow for the muscles in the eye to relax.

##### Micro-breaks
Most typing and mousing are done intermittently in bursts rather than as continuous movements.
So when you are on that intermit break, you should rest your hands in a relaxed, straight posture. Breaks every 15 minutes allow for decreased reports of eyestrain, blurred vision, and elbow and arm discomfort complaints. Additionally, it allows for the most efficient performance of computer tasks.

##### Rest breaks
To allow the body to improve blood circulation, and reduce the accumulation of static muscle fatigue, he recommends taking a *brief rest break* where they stand up, move around, and step away from the comupter. 

##### The Exercise breaks
To reduce muscle fatigue, *gentle exercises* can be done every 1-2h. Specific examples of excersises that can be done are listed in Chapter 10 in the *General Body Exercises* section. (Ashnel, 169)
A few listed below:
- A Pectoral strech
- A Disk Reliever
- Pelvic Tilt
- Head Roll

# What does the app Interlude actually do?
<img width="1269" alt="test" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68393684/188495793-ee23cae6-fc9b-444a-8a9b-271c9327dbb0.png">
I developed this app to remind you to participate in the techniques from the Methods section. Humans have trouble sticking to self-guided regulation, so this app offloads pressure on you to remember to stay healthy and break. In the book, Ashnel mentions that it would be best to have an application built to instruct you when to break. (Ashnel, 153)

Interlude aims to give your eyes, body, and mind the proper break it needs by following a scientifically researched interval of breaks and actions to perform during those breaks. 

Every twenty minutes, the user is guided to take a break from whatever task they are doing by displaying an overlay across their entire screen. 

Every sixty minutes over a single session, the user is guided to move around and step away from their keyboard.

Every second hour over a single session, the user is guided to perform some stretches and physical activity. Stretches will be recommended to the user from the pop-up screen.

The app contains instructions and animations of stretches to relieve stiffness and pain from sitting behind a computer for a prolonged period.

Interlude has a settings page to make overlays best fitting for you liking
Examples include:
- Less intrusive overlays through the way of notifications
- background color changes
- ability to increase/decrease interval overlay period
