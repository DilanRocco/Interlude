## things still to do with the app

- section about the book written by Jeffrey Ashnel
https://theswiftdev.com/how-to-launch-a-macos-app-at-login/
- page for the streches
- deal with dark mode. Making the icon black when bar is white in menu bar as well. all around the app as well.

- fix overlays for one hour and two hour
- fix text make sure it is all grammaratically correct

## app landing page
- Promotional Text - 170 characters 
- App store description/pictures/privacy policy - all of that stuff needs to be sorted out 
- Description - 4000 characters 
- 
- ## Later ticket
- make the streches and the break thing a paid user edition, also some of the settings could be a paid user thing. 

## After 
- finish the github read.me

## completed items: </br >
- Full Screen that displays 
- Best way to do a timer - may have answered this </br>
- Icon at the top that progressively shows that you are runnning out of time for the twenty minutes.
- app name is going to be called downtime
- build the menu bar app fully, and the settings page, where you can edit all the preferences like how frequently the screen shows up, or if you want the program to run on start
- monitor settings, overlay working for monitior
- colored <1 alpha value pages for screen overlay - just mess with some of the numbers to make it perfect for the specified colors. 
- make things pretty - menubar included
- Notificaitons are working smoothly
- error to deal with the notifications not enabled
- (big item) I also need to have to animate the character streches - learn how to do after effects/blender need to learn how to animate a default character for the streches </br>
- make the overlay fade-in instead of being so quick
## compeleted-ish items that still running
- A lot of settings need to use user-defaults to store data
- Learn how data interacts with the Views. </br>
- time left in the menubar or time/or a hourglass 
- page for you open the app for the first time

## settings that do exist
- 1. ability to change the time for how long screen time is 
- 2. ability to change the intermission time
- 3. ability to skip the current session
- 4. ability to change the background color when the screen overlay appears.
- 5. ability to change from obtrustive overlays to notifications


#LARGE TICKET ITEMS I SHOULD FINISH

- generally want to make app different than intermission

##Being Different:
This is a hard one because there isn't really a set amount of difference we have to get towards.
Streches help 
Break overlay looks similar to intermission, but not an insane amount
